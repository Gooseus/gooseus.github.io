<h3 id="the-author">The Author</h3>

<p>I am Shawn Marincas, Gooseus is my online alias and pen name (pronounced &ldquo;goosey-yus&rdquo;).  It&rsquo;s a Latinized version of my HS nickname (which was not a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun" target="_blank">Top Gun</a>) which I adapted for myself in college after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)" target="_blank">Gladiator</a> and needing an Xbox Live handle.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m originally from Brick, New Jersey and am now a resident of Portland, Oregon.  My only formal education is a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and I&rsquo;m employed full-time as a web developer (or fullstack engineer, or whatever the trending title is).  I consider myself an autodidact and hope that someday I&rsquo;ll be able to consider myself a polymath, but for now I can only claim to be conversational in many subjects and an expert in very few, if any.</p>

<p>While internet technology is the focus of my job, I&rsquo;m far more interested in the subjects of philosophy, math, science, history, psychology, economics, and any others that involve understanding the myriad ways the Universe interacts with itself.</p>

<p>I have recently declared myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">poetic naturalist</a>, following the philosophical framework formalized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll" target="_blank">Dr. Sean Carroll</a> to describe someone who is a naturalist, but also believes that there are many good ways of talking about the world, so long as they are grounded in scientific truth and are useful for talking about a particular domain.</p>

<p>I am an agnostic at heart, but enjoy useful stories involving metaphorical god constructs.  I believe that Knowledge is a fundamental unit of Life and self-knowledge would be the goal of any pantheistic God, this follows from my favorite quote by my favorite person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.”<br />
~ Carl Sagan, 1990</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to expand and formalize my philosophy of Life, the Universe and Knowledge (Everything) through open, honest and good faith discussion of my various <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a>.  To start I have waded into treacherous philosophical waters with a statement of what I believe is <a href="/thoughts/a-purpose-for-life">Life&rsquo;s ultimate purpose</a>.</p>

<p>As I hope to make clear over time, this philosophy of purpose gives rise to a loose ethical framework and will, hopefully, also foster a network of like-minded individuals and groups who honor knowledge and seek to shape the future of our world with reason and compassion.</p>

<h3 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a straight, white, cis, able-bodied, middle-class male and I make no apologies.  While I acknowledge the privilege of not having faced much systemic oppression, I have spent plenty of my life dealing with periodic depression and anxiety, as well as the consequences of believing deeply in the truth and caring more about being honest and knowledgeable than beautiful, popular or successful.</p>

<p>My site is not a safe space for anyone, least of all those who do not honor knowledge, truth and compassion as the highest virtues.  While it should be clear from my stated intentions that I am not here to offend anyone needlessly, I assume it as an inevitability and may have already done so while writing this section.  If you are sensitive to any kinds of triggers, please find another website to read; the Internet is a big enough place for all of us.</p>

<p>Links to books I recommend or reference will be <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Affiliate</a> links, meaning I will get a percentage of a purchase using that link.  It is the only form of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; that will appear on this site and is the only revenue stream.  Honestly, the joy of seeing that people are taking my recommendations will be of much greater value than whatever fraction of a cent I&rsquo;ll generate from affiliate book sales.</p>

<p>I may borrow quotes and images from these books and other works, some of which may not be licensed for reuse or modification.  For this, I will apologize and remove the work if requested, though I am committted to doing my best to properly attribute/cite all borrowed works while seeking the proper permissions.</p>

<h3 id="the-website">The Website</h3>

<p>This site was built with <a href="https://gohugo.com" target="_blank">Hugo Static Site Generator v0.34</a> starting with the <a href="https://github.com/vimux/blank/" target="_blank">blank starter theme</a>, <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css" target="_blank">normalize.css v7.0.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/devinhunt/typebase.css" target="_blank">typebase.css v0.1.0</a>.  The CSS is optimized using the <a href="https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css-cli" target="_blank">clean-css CLI optimizer v4.1.10</a>.</p>

<p>The rest has been hand-coded and is very much a work in progress.  I don&rsquo;t use any trackers or analytics, in fact, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any javascript on the page at all, though I may add some light vanilla for flavoring in the future.</p>

<p>If you find something broken or wonky, put in an issue at the <a href="https://github.com/Gooseus/gooseus.github.io" target="_blank">Github repo</a> or else drop me a line via one of the contacts in the footer below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> with SSL and caching provided by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a>.  Special thanks to my wonderful girlfriend and my Ninjastack peeps for all their help in finally getting this up.</p>
