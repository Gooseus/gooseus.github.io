      <description>The Author I am Shawn Marincas, Gooseus is my online alias and pen name (pronounced &amp;ldquo;goosey-yus&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s a Latinized version of my HS nickname (which was not a reference to Top Gun) which I adapted for my Xbox Live handle in college after watching Gladiator. Now I just like how it makes me sound like a real philospher. Yes, I am a nerd.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Brick, New Jersey and am now a resident of Portland, Oregon.</description>

      <title>The Purpose of Life</title>

      <description>So lets start by being clear with what I mean by &amp;ldquo;The Purpose of Life&amp;rdquo;. What I&amp;rsquo;m referring to is the chemical process we call Life, the one that would be observable by some outside being if they were to come across Earth. That&amp;rsquo;s Life with the capital &amp;lsquo;L&amp;rsquo;, and it includes your life and every other life on the planet, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t about making any value judgments on what you are doing with your personal life.</description>
