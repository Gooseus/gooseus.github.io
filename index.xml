      <description>The Author I am Shawn Marincas, Gooseus is my online alias and pen name (pronounced &amp;ldquo;goosey-yus&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s a Latinized version of my HS nickname (which was not a reference to Top Gun) which I adapted for my Xbox Live handle in college after watching Gladiator. Now I just like how it makes me sound like a real philospher. Yes, I am a nerd.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Brick, New Jersey and am now a resident of Portland, Oregon.</description>

      <title>The Purpose of Life</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by clarifying what I mean by &amp;ldquo;The Purpose of Life&amp;rdquo;. What I&amp;rsquo;m to referring here is the chemical process we call Life; a unique process that any intelligent beings would observe while studying our planet. This is Life with a capital &amp;lsquo;L&amp;rsquo;, and while it includes you and every other living being on the planet, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about making value judgments regarding what you are doing with your personal life.</description>
