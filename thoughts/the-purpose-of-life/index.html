<p>So lets start by being clear with what I mean by &ldquo;The Purpose of Life&rdquo;.  What I&rsquo;m referring to is the chemical process we call Life, the one that would be observable by some outside being if they were to come across Earth. That&rsquo;s Life with the capital &lsquo;L&rsquo;, and it includes your life and every other life on the planet, but it isn&rsquo;t about making any value judgments on what you are doing with your personal life.</p>

<p>You can feel free to align your life&rsquo;s purpose with the one I outline here for Life, but you&rsquo;re part of the overall purpose whether you like it or not.  So, if we&rsquo;re clear on this, I&rsquo;ll stop capitalizing Life as I get the sense that it&rsquo;ll get annoying.  Just use context clues and when in doubt assume it&rsquo;s not about you.</p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<h3 id="sean-carroll-s-big-picture-foundation">Sean Carroll&rsquo;s Big Picture Foundation</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried many times to articulate a purpose for life, without much success.  Beginning with all the foundational terms and principles and outlining them properly in context is daunting and I&rsquo;d prefer to skip it altogether.  But due diligence must be done, if for no other reason than to make sure my idea hasn&rsquo;t already been popularized and/or rendered moot by some prior academic giant.</p>

<p>As I consumed philosophy books and podcasts, I didn&rsquo;t come across anyone that had hit upon the point I was trying to make.  I also found that most philosophical frameworks were difficult to build on.  They either involved talking about purpose from a personal perspective or else delved deep into Reality and Being, usually seeking to prove or disprove the involvement of God.</p>

<p>Then I came across Dr. Sean Carroll&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2Bsmws2" target="_blank"><em>The Big Picture</em></a>, and I found exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>He covered all the ground that I wanted to, much better than I ever could, and then outlined a framework I could use for my own purposes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">Poetic Naturalism</a>.  However, as I read more, I was sure Carroll had either reached the same conclusions or had already dismissed them in some fundamental way.</p>

<p>Yet, when I had finished the book and looked up some of his related work, I realized that Carroll had not reached the same conclusions regarding the purpose of life.  In fact, his train of thought had cleared many of the obstacles out of my way and left me at the doorstep, leaving me to just walk on through.</p>

<h3 id="cliffsnotes-from-minutephysics">CliffsNotes from MinutePhysics</h3>

<p>Of course, resting so much of my own work on his newest book means leaves me with 430 pages of required reading in order for any audience to understand what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>However, luck is with me again as Carroll and Henry Reich, from the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg" target="_blank">MinutePhysics</a> channel, have already covered the key points I need in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoaVOjvkzQtyZF-2VpJrxPz7bxK_p1Dd2" target="_blank">5-part video series</a> that is a combined length of only 21 minutes!</p>

<p>Even if you have already read <em>The Big Picture</em>, I would highly recommend watching the videos since some concepts are restated differently and MinutePhysics is just spectacular.  I&rsquo;m going to embed some videos and try to lean on their content more than the book.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="the-big-picture-philosophy">The Big Picture Philosophy</h3>

<p>Carroll doesn&rsquo;t get into his philosophical framework in the MinutePhysics videos, so let&rsquo;s quickly restate the tenets of poetic naturalism as defined in <em>The Big Picture</em><a name="ref-0"><a href="#note-0">[0]</a></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naturalism comes down to three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only one world, the natural world.</li>
<li>The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.</li>
<li>The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially, naturalism is the idea that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world.  The poetic aspect comes to the fore when we start talking about that world.  It can also be summarized in three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are many ways of talking about the world.</li>
<li>All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.</li>
<li>Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.</li>
</ol>

<p>(p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is relatively straightforward and much of the book discusses how the emergence of different levels of observable phenomenon can be described using stories that match our understanding of how the world works scientifically, and are useful within a particular domain.</p>

<h3 id="the-russell-and-carroll-stories-of-life-s-purpose">The Russell and Carroll Stories of Life&rsquo;s Purpose</h3>

<p>Returning to the purpose of life, it seems that many stories could exist, so long as they adhere to these tenets.  The only point where Carroll directly references a &ldquo;purpose of life&rdquo; appears at the beginning of chapter 32, &ldquo;The Origin and Purpose of Life&rdquo;, where he recalls a chance encounter with Dr. Michael Russell, an astrobiologist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>While both were en-route from northern California to a conference in Montana they were ended up seated next to each other on the same plane.  When Russell happened to notice that Carroll was studying statistical physics in relation to the origins of life, he commented on his familiarity with the work.  When Carroll asked his opinion on life&rsquo;s purpose as it related to the work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy&rdquo;, he replied with a nod.  &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(p. 261)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, I expected Carroll to put forth another story of purpose that would be apply in a higher level domain.  Instead he moved on to cover many other related topics, but never quite returned to a higher level story.</p>

<p>However, he does cover this in more detail in the final video of the MinutePhysics series where he reaches a different conclusion to Russell&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="youtube-player dim-hover" data-id="HxTnqKuNygE">
	<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HxTnqKuNygE/maxresdefault.jpg" />
	<div class="play"></div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a very real sense, the purpose of life is to continue the mission of the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(t. 3:38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This mission, as outlined in the video, is to provide a path for energy to increase entropy, proceeding from useful concentrated energy toward useless diffused energy.</p>

<p>This is where I hijack the Sean Carroll thought-train and divert it to my own track.</p>

<h3 id="the-gooseus-story-of-life-s-purpose">The Gooseus Story of Life&rsquo;s Purpose</h3>

<p>As much I enjoy doing my part to hydrogenate the carbon dioxide of Earth, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t get me out of bed in the morning.  And while providing a path for the inevitable increase of entropy is relatively simple to grasp, it&rsquo;s also relatively pointless.  Both are true, but they seem to be missing something meaningful about what makes life different from every other chemical process.</p>

<p>My story is just as simple and really I&rsquo;m just taking Carroll&rsquo;s story, adding a line, and then filling in some space, quite literally.  The line was actually already drawn by Carroll in his book, and also by Reich in the third video in his series.</p>

<div class="youtube-player dim-hover" data-id="MTFY0H4EZx4">

</div>

<p>In the book, Carroll discusses the evolution of complexity and entropy within closed systems (ch. 28, p. 225).  Over time, the entropy of a closed system always increases, while the complexity of the system will increase and then decrease in a parabola.</p>

<p>Carroll builds his purpose off the entropy line and I build mine from the complexity curve.  It&rsquo;s easier to see where I&rsquo;m coming from in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTFY0H4EZx4&amp;list=PLoaVOjvkzQtyZF-2VpJrxPz7bxK_p1Dd2&amp;index=3" target="_blank">the third video of the MinutePhysics series</a>, where Reich adds some drawings and additional labels to the same graph.</p>

<p>We exist in the middle of this graph, at a nondescript point of &ldquo;medium entropy&rdquo; on the entropy line, but at the vertex of the complexity parabola.  What is left unstated here is the fact that life is by far the most complex process in the known Universe.  It defines what will be the highest point on that curve.</p>

<p>Defining the high point on the complexity curve also means that life determines where on the time axis the curve will turn back toward simplicity.  This happens when the complexity of life declines, and while unconscious life does not have the ability to consider that eventuality, conscious life most certainly does.</p>

<p>It is self-evident since I am doing it right now with you.  And here we come to my story for the purpose of life:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve within its enclosing system.</strong></p>

<h3 id="life-s-complexity-curve">Life&rsquo;s Complexity Curve</h3>

<p>If we could actually plot the complexity of life on Earth over the time since it began, it would not look like that smooth parabola.  Considering that complexity is defined by the amount of information needed to describe a system, I think that a good guide would be a graph of the biodiversity of life over time.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ll defer to Youtube for a beautiful overview, this one provided by Emily Elert of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiYXex_fwgYDonaTcSIk6w" target="_blank">MinuteEarth channel</a>.</p>

<p>She describes the difficulty of generating biodiversity data from the fossil record, but given what we do know, we have built a relatively accurate graph covering 542 million years of living history.  One such graph can be found on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event" target="_blank">Extinction Event</a>, but a more accessible version was published recently on the <a href="http://www.bitsofscience.org/" target="_blank">Bits of Science website</a>:</p>

<p>We can assume the future will follow a similar trend based on our understanding of how often certain geological and cosmological events are likely to occur.  This Wikipedia page plots out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future" target="_blank">timeline of the far future</a>, and points out many possible sources of mass extinction before the sun&rsquo;s luminosity increases to the point where it disrupts the carbon-silicate cycle and ends C3 photosynthesis, wiping out ~99% of plant species.</p>

<p>Even if life continues the upward trend in complexity to that point, it will need to adapt drastically in order to maintain it, otherwise the complexity curve for Earth will begin its final slide downward toward simplicity.</p>

<p>The biodiversity graph extends back ~542 million years and the sun&rsquo;s luminosity is expected to begin disrupting the carbon-silicate cycle in ~600 million years.  This puts us roughly in the middle of the overall timeline for the complexity of life on Earth.</p>

<p>Speaking of us, let&rsquo;s consider how conscious life affects the complexity curve.</p>

<h3 id="complexity-from-consciousness">Complexity from Consciousness</h3>

<p>Again, if we take that complexity is defined by the amount of information required to describe the state of system, it seems that consciousness would require a significantly larger amount of information to describe the near infinite possible mental states compared to a non-conscious organism.  These near-infinite possible mental states is what gives rise to immensely complex behaviors of conscious beings and the particular abilities we ascribe to them, including creativity and rationality.</p>

<p>This is just a single mind, when further considering how multiple minds can interact to create the myriad forms of social groups, languages, cultures, civilizations and technologies; the complexity curve for a living system containing conscious life-forms becomes immediately skewed upward.</p>

<p>Consciousness changes everything with regard to potential complexity in a system and it also creates a massive opportunity for the living system it is part of, assuming it can leverage its capabilities effectively and align itself with this purpose of life.</p>

<p>Here is where my story of purpose becomes meaningful for conscious beings, such as ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="the-purpose-of-conscious-life">The Purpose of Conscious Life</h3>

<p>Remember, the purpose is to optimize the area under the curve, not to simply seek a maximum for the curve.</p>

<p>Complexity comes at a cost and the enclosing system is finite, so if conscious life purely seeks a maximum, then it will almost certainly trigger a mass extinction by way of resource depletion, possibly destroying themselves in the process and making their contribution to the complexity curve a simple saw-toothed spike.  Hardly meaningful to the overall area under the curve.</p>

<p>Many people believe this what is being observed currently in what is being called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction" target="_blank">Holocene Extinction</a>.  If conscious life removes large amounts of biodiversity in order to generate resources toward maximizes the peak complexity at the expense of maximizing the area under the curve, then they are not aligned with the purpose of life.</p>

<p>Human beings have a consciousness that can recognize and study patterns, they can understand complexity and measure it&rsquo;s effects on systems.  Lately, many great minds have studied the nature of complexity and written extensively on the problems faced when it grows too large, too fast:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter" target="_blank">Joseph A. Tainter&rsquo;s</a> book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2HbhZhK" target="_blank">The Collapse of Complex Societies</a>, covers this topic from an archaeological point of view, extensively studying past civilizations and how increased complexity within societies generates diminishing marginal returns with regards to energy economics.  This was also covered in a related paper, <a href="https://www.goldonomic.com/tainter.htm" target="_blank">Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Crutchfield" target="_blank">James P. Crutchfield&rsquo;s</a> paper <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/papers/FOCS.pdf" target="_blank">The Hidden Fragilities of Complex Systems - Consequences of Change, Changing Consequences</a> discusses how &ldquo;Short-term survival and an exuberant plunge into building our future are generating a new kind of unintended consequence&emdash;hidden fragility.&ldquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb" target="_blank">Nassim Nicolas Taleb</a> covers the topic of fragility and complexity extensively in both of his works, <a href="http://amzn.to/2HdegR0" target="_blank">The Black Swan</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2CjJoKI" target="_blank">Antifragile</a>.  His ideas on robustness and anti-fragility are invaluable when considering how humans should pursue the purpose I&rsquo;ve been outlining.</p>

<p>Increasing complexity is tied to the purpose, but doing so without regard to the effect on the overall system or considering the risks of increased fragility dooms the effort.</p>

<p>There are many ways we can increase complexity while reducing fragility and maintaining the biodiversity, but since I&rsquo;m over 2250 words, I&rsquo;ll save that for another time and instead focus one thing we can do to change the overall equation.</p>

<h3 id="expanding-the-enclosing-system">Expanding the Enclosing System</h3>

<p>So once again, with some different emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve <em>within its enclosing system</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypothetical complexity graph covering 542 million years ago to 600 million years from now is the best case scenario for the closed system we call Earth.  But thanks to the evolution of conscious life, the invention of science, and the abundant resources available within this system, conscious life has the opportunity to expand this enclosing system.</p>

<p>On February 6th, 2018, the Falcon Heavy rocket was successfully launched by SpaceX.  Elon Musk&rsquo;s ambition is to bring humans to Mars within the next couple decades and to eventually terraform the planet and allow it to sustain the life of Earth.</p>

<p>This is an example of leveraging our capabilities in alignment with the purpose of life.  If successful, there would be two enclosing systems and so a major disaster on Earth would not necessarily mean the end of humans or life in general.  When the sun&rsquo;s increasing luminosity moves the &ldquo;Goldilocks Zone&rdquo; beyond Earth, it will then include Mars.  This could add hundreds of millions of years to our timeline which would massively increase the potential area under the complexity curve.</p>

<p>With further advances in space technology and a dedication to long-term thinking, we could even reach the point where the entire solar system is considered the enclosing system.  This would add billions of years to the timeline; you see where I&rsquo;m going here.</p>

<p>In fact, we don&rsquo;t actually even need to get to the point of terraforming Mars in order to have a direct and lasting effect on increasing the area under the curve.  We can expand the system with some bigger picture thinking, like the type being done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_N._Mautner" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Mautner</a> of the <a href="http://www.panspermia-society.com/" target="_blank">the Panspermia Society</a>.</p>

<p>Mautner outlines a plan for sending swarms of extremely small capsules filled with robust microbes toward stellar clouds where new planets are currently forming.  The hope being that some may find purchase on these new worlds and jump start new living systems from our genetic family.</p>

<p>The technology involved is extremely basic compared to planet terraforming and with some very long term planning could even be the key to growing new worlds for us to find later, should we ever master interstellar travel.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many stories we can tell about the nature of life and its purpose.  These stories need to be compatible with each other and they need to match our scientific understanding of how the world actually works.  The best stories are the ones that meet these requirements and are most applicable to the questions under consideration.</p>

<p>When considering the relationship between life&rsquo;s purpose and entropy, and the relationship between entropy and complexity, a story that relates life&rsquo;s purpose directly to complexity appears compatible.  When considering the relationship that conscious, problem-solving life-forms have to complexity, this story seems quite applicable.</p>

<p>Entropy increases whether consciousness succeeds or fails, we can&rsquo;t help but succeed in that purpose.  Maximizing the area under the complexity curve requires us to continue to learn how the complex systems of the Universe evolve, including the ones inside ourselves and the ones we create to support our problem-solving efforts.</p>

<p>By building our complex systems in alignment with the purpose of life, human beings can push the inevitable downward slide of the curve far into the future, maximizing the area under the curve, while creating a Universe teeming with beautifully diverse complexity.</p>
