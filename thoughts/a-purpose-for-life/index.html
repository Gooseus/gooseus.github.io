			<h2>A Purpose for Life</h2>
			<time>January 25, 2018</time>
			
			<div>
				

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried many times to articulate a purpose for Life without much success.  I usually begin well enough and then find myself lost in the weeds as I realize that I haven&rsquo;t grounded the concepts of Life or Purpose well enough on a foundation of core philosophical terms and principles.</p>

<p>Reading philosophy and listening to philosophy podcasts, I hadn&rsquo;t found anybody from the distant or recent past that had quite hit upon the points I was trying to make, and also found that being a great philosophical mind did not always correlate with being a great writer.  This was both frustrating and encouraging.  I felt I had unique ideas to put forth, but couldn&rsquo;t quite find the right philosophical framework to build on and did not enjoy the prospect of starting from scratch, as many philosophers have enjoyed doing.</p>

<p>But then I found myself reading a copy of Dr. Sean Carroll&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2Bsmws2" target="_blank"><em>The Big Picture</em></a> and I quickly got the sense that I had found what I was looking for.  As I poured through all the groundwork of he had laid out and developed an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">poetic naturalism</a> I was again both delighted and discouraged, this time for opposite reasons.  I was delighted at having finally found a foundation for my ideas, but was sure Dr. Carroll had either reached my same conclusions or had preemptively eviscerated them.</p>

<p>Yet, when I had finished the book and looked up some of his related work, I realized that Carroll had not reached the same conclusions regarding the purpose of Life and had not really put up any obstacles.  In fact, his train of thought had cleared many of my obstacles, delivered me to within spitting distance of my destination, and provided me with a set of shiny new tools with which to clear the rest of the way!  So here goes nothing.</p>

<h3 id="life-as-a-whole">Life as a Whole</h3>

<p>First, let me say that when I describe a purpose for life, I am not referring to an individual life.  While my personal ethic and moral framework are based on the points I&rsquo;ll be laying out, their details will have to be an essay for another day.  What I&rsquo;m concerned with today is &ldquo;What is the purpose of the process of life as a whole?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I do not believe that life is unique to Earth, and perhaps the life of Earth may not even be unique to Earth (another discussion for another day).  Without observing life outside our planet, we can only speculate.  However, I believe that the conclusion I reach would apply to any form we could call Life in any part of the Universe, so I will be positing it as a universal truth, at my own peril.</p>

<h3 id="poetic-naturalism">Poetic Naturalism</h3>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s quickly outline the tenets of poetic naturalism as defined in <em>The Big Picture</em><a name="ref-0"><a href="#note-0">[0]</a></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naturalism comes down to three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only one world, the natural world.</li>
<li>The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.</li>
<li>The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially, naturalism is the idea that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world.  The poetic aspect comes to the for when we start talking about the world.  It can also be summarized in three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are many ways of talking about the world.</li>
<li>All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.</li>
<li>Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.</li>
</ol>

<p>(p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about individual interactions between atoms you will use a different narrative and language than when you&rsquo;re discussing large collections of atoms.  Quantum and molecular interactions are definitely taking place within gases, however, for the purposes of analyzing the properties of gases the best way of talking isn&rsquo;t to invoke wave functions, but to discuss the gas laws.</p>

<p>This is relatively straightforward and much of the book discusses how the emergence of different levels of observable phenomenon can be used to develop true and useful stories of how the world works within this framework.</p>

<h3 id="michael-russell-s-purpose-narrative">Michael Russell&rsquo;s Purpose Narrative</h3>

<p>So, returning to the Purpose of Life, it seems to me that many true stories could exist, so long as they follow these tenets.  The only direct reference to a &ldquo;purpose of life&rdquo; that Carroll refers to in his book appears at the beginning of chapter 32, &ldquo;The Origin and Purpose of Life&rdquo;, where he recalls a chance encounter with Dr. Michael Russell, a geochemist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>While both were en route from northern California to a conference in Montana they happened to be seated next to each other on the same plane.  When Russell happened to notice that Carroll was studying statistical physics in relation to the origins of life, he commented on his familiarity with the work.  When Carroll asked his opinion on life&rsquo;s purpose as it related to the work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy&rdquo;, he replied with a nod.  &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(p. 261)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I proceeded from this point, I kept expecting Carroll to refer to this simply as a true story at the level of the chemical process of life and then put forth another story of purpose that would be useful at a higher level.  This story never manifested, even as it turned toward evolution and emergence (including an entire chapter on &ldquo;Emergent Purpose&rdquo;), and then on to consciousness and morality.</p>

<h3 id="my-purpose-narrative">My Purpose Narrative</h3>

<p>So now I get the opportunity to present a narrative that is as simple and true as Dr. Russell&rsquo;s, but, I believe, more meaningful at the human level.  As much I enjoy doing my part to hydrogenate the carbon dioxide of Earth, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t get me out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p>Earlier in the book Carroll discusses the evolution of complexity and entropy within closed systems (ch. 28, p. 225).  This section is also covered in <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/11/03/entropy-and-complexity-cause-and-effect-life-and-time/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/" target="_blank">Carroll&rsquo;s website</a> in a beautiful series of videos by Henry Reich and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics" target="_blank">MinutePhysics</a> team.</p>

<p>Over time, the entropy of a closed system always increases, while the complexity of the system will increase and then decrease in a parabola.</p>

<p>Life is the ultimate complex system, since organisms can use free energy (increase entropy) to maintain out-of-equilibrium states<a name="ref-1"><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></a> and within the domain of life, the most complex system would be the human brain itself, making the human brain the ultimate in complexity density in the known universe.  I think an observation can be made by looking at the effect that life has on the complexity of a system that contains it, and from this observation we can derive a guiding narrative of Life&rsquo;s purpose:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve within the enclosing system.</strong></p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Life seeks to maximize the area under the Complexity function as Entropy increases</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>While Russell&rsquo;s narrative applies to the known Life we observe on this planet, where the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is the main mechanism by which the system increases entropy, I believe that this narrative would apply to any process we could find in the Universe that we would call Life.  Also, by looking at the history of human technological and social development, we can find a similar pattern in how humans have done their part to increase complexity without awareness of this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="complexity-from-problem-solving">Complexity from Problem Solving</h3>

<p>Looking at the history of Life, we see billions of years where life has increased its biological complexity through evolution, and over millions of years of human history we see how humanity has increased technological complexity through conscious innovation.</p>

<p>Evolution and innovation serve the same purposes; at the level of the organism/species and individual/organization, they introduce new mechanisms to solve problems related to the survival and reproduction of genetics, fortunes, products, institutions, culture, knowledge, etc.</p>

<p>Carroll describes the process of natural selection as a search algorithm (ch. 34, p. 279), with evolution solving the problem of &ldquo;What organism would survive and reproduce most effectively in this particular environment?&rdquo;.  The genome of each organism is a potential solution to this problem, the solutions that prove effective combine their genome with another effective solution in sexual reproduction, and a new generation of potential solutions is created.  Ineffective solutions are selected out by death or failure to reproduce.</p>

<p>Human innovation in free societies conduct a similar search algorithm where individuals and groups identify a problem and propose solutions.  Selection mechanisms are used to prune the solutions (prototype testing, rigorous debate, capitalist markets, etc.) and the best solution is then adopted by the society at large.  Each solution is designed to confer an advantage on those that adopt it, usually saving time or energy, as well as on the innovators, as financial or political power.</p>

<p>However, these solutions incur a cost, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter" target="_blank">Joseph Tainter</a> addresses in his paper <a href="https://www.goldonomic.com/tainter.htm" target="_blank">Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies</a>, where he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Systems of problem solving develop greater complexity and higher costs over long periods. &hellip; For the past 12,000 years human societies have seemed almost inexorably to grow more complex. For the most part this has been successful: complexity confers advantages, and one of the reasons for our success as a species has been our ability to &lsquo;Increase rapidly the complexity of our behavior (Tainter 1992, 1995b). Yet complexity can also be detrimental to sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tainter argues that complexity arises by way of inceasing the number of parts and by the increased specialization of those parts.</p>

<p>In orgnanisms and ecosystems this can be observed by looking at the large number of niche organisms that are perfectly adapted to a specific environment by possessing adaptations that are highly specialized for that environment.</p>

<p>Orchids are an example in natural organisms as each species is specifically adapted to attract a specific pollinator.  In human civilization with the specializations of jobs that only do specific tasks in a large organization.  This is also observable with the by looking at the specialization of products and scientific disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="problems-from-complexity">Problems from Complexity</h3>

<p>The costs of complexity is what makes it impossible to sustain high levels for long periods of time on the complexity graph.  Energy is required to solve each subsequent problem and to the maintain the solutions to the previously solved problems.  This means that increased complexity produces diminishing returns on the energy spent.</p>

<p>In addition, high complexity also introduces a harder to identify problem, fragility.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb" target="_blank">Nassim Nicolas Taleb</a> defines fragility in his book <a href="http://amzn.to/2FCmT63" target="_blank">Antifragile</a><a href=""><a href="#note-3">[3]</a>&lt;/&gt; as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suddenly realized one day that fragility&mdash;which had been lacking a technical definition&mdash;could be expressed as <em>what does not like volatility</em>, and that <em>what does not like volatility</em> does not like randomness, uncertainty, disorders, errors, stressors, etc.</p>

<p>(p. 11-12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As parts become more specialized they depend more on other parts in order to operate as a whole.  This creation of interdependence means that errors or disruptions in a single area creates a cascading effects.  In orchids, a disruption in the behavior of their specialized pollinator is devastating.</p>

<p>If we could graph the complexity of Earth from its formation, it would not look like the clean parabola from early.  Instead, it would follow along quite nicely with a graph of speciations and extinctions in slow rises and relatively sharp falls.</p>

<p>Life has driven the upward curves of complexity through evolutionary problem solving and massive environmental changes have driven the steep downward slopes through cosmological, geological and ecological mechanisms in the forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor" target="_blank">meteor impacts</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps" target="_blank">volcanic eruptions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" target="_blank">run-away biochemistry</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>When a massive change occurs in the environment, it changes what solutions are considered the most effective and it is typically those organisms and institutions which are most specialized to the old environment and those which are most complex that are the first to fail.  The survivors are the simplest organisms and the generalists, which prove to be the most robust.  After a new environment stabilizes, they immediately begin to evolve and specialize within this new environment, repeating the cycle.</p>

<p>A graph specific to the complexity of human civilizations would look very similar to life as a whole.  Humans mimic the same cycles of increased complexity and fragility followed by a reduction once the energy needed to maintain complexity becomes too great and a disruption (or set of disruptions) precipitates a rapid reduction in complexity.</p>

<p>We are playing the same game that Life has for billions of years, so in order to continue the upward trend of complexity and avoid the downward trends (thus maximizing the area under the curve) we must come to understand this nature of complexity and learn from the mistakes and successes of our ancestors, both distant and recent.</p>

<h3 id="our-finite-system">Our Finite System</h3>

<p>So in order to increase the area under the curve, complexity must be added to the system in a way that minimizes fragility.  And since increases to complexity create diminishing returns on energy use, the available energy must always be increasing to meet the increasing demand.</p>

<p>However, the available energy in a given system is finite.  If a system becomes too complex without applying that available energy to solving the problem of increasing the available energy, it is doomed to collapse.  On earth this happens in closed ecosystems in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(population)" target="_blank">overshoot</a>.</p>

<p>The complex systems that humans create are no different, and much of the existing complexity is based on the easily accessible energy resources provided by fossil fuels.  Humans have applied a lot of energy to solving the problem of making energy available through alternative sources, but the complexity have not been introduced in a way that has minimized fragility.</p>

<p>Environmental damage from exploration, drilling, transportation and refining have created disasters that affect already fragile ecosystems that contain massive amounts of living complexity.  The negative effects of utilizing these fossil fuel sources have accelerated environmental changes and created more extreme weather patterns that test the fragile infrastructure upon which our complexity rests.</p>

<h3 id="expanding-the-system">Expanding the System</h3>

<p>In order for the Life of Earth to truly maximize the area under the curve, it must create a more robust and clean system of supplying energy and allow complex ecosystems to recover.  However, solving these problems will only stave off the run-away overshoot problem that humans are creating.  Life is still fragile to the geological and cosmological mechanisms that have caused steep reductions in complexity in the past.</p>

<p>What humans must do to fulfill their role in the project of Life is to use apply their innovative problem-solving skills to expand the system that contains Life.  The only way to do that is to make Life an extra-planetary and then multi-planetary phenomenon.  Solving this problem will require a massive amount of added complexity and available energy, so the only way to make it happen is to re-evaluate our priorities and reallocate how we are spending resources now.</p>
