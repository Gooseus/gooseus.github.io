<h3 id="this-isn-t-about-you">This Isn&rsquo;t About You</h3>

<p>So lets start by being clear with what I mean by &ldquo;purpose of Life&rdquo;.  What I&rsquo;m referring to is the collective chemical process we call Life, the one that would be observable from an outside perspective if some other beings were studying the Universe one planet at a time and came across Earth.  Just like we&rsquo;re currently hoping to find on exoplanets, they would see evidence of something happening.  That something that is happening is what I&rsquo;m calling Life with the capital &lsquo;L&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That Life consists of the aggregated actions of you and I and every other human and living creature on the planet, so any purpose we have individually feeds into this purpose whether you want it to or not.  The point I&rsquo;m here to make is that this Life I&rsquo;m talking about has a purpose all its own, and whatever you believe about your personal purpose, it is ultimately irrelevant when considering the purpose of Life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not making any value judgments on what you are doing with your life personally.  You can feel free to align your life&rsquo;s purpose with the one I outline here for Life, but I&rsquo;m not going to get into that today.</p>

<p>To be even more clear, I&rsquo;m not even talking about the purpose for Life on Earth.  It&rsquo;s the only version of Life we can know, so it&rsquo;s the only one I can really refer to without thought experiments, but the purpose I&rsquo;m outlining actually refers to any chemical process that could be considered Life.  If we find that Life is happening on another planet outside our solar system, I believe it will be carrying out this purpose as well.</p>

<p>So, if we&rsquo;re clear on this, then I&rsquo;ll stop capitalizing Life as I get the sense that it&rsquo;ll get annoying and it seems a little pretentious.  I prefer my pretensions to be less obvious and I suck at proof-reading, so I&rsquo;d inevitably mess it up anyways.  From here on out lets just use context clues.  Cool?  Cool.  Alright, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<h3 id="sean-carroll-s-big-picture-foundation">Sean Carroll&rsquo;s Big Picture Foundation</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried many times to articulate a purpose for life without much success.  I usually begin well enough and then find myself lost in the weeds as I realize that my philosophy chops are far too weak.  Beginning with all the foundational terms and principles and outlining them properly in context is daunting and I&rsquo;d prefer to skip it altogether.  But the due diligence must be done, if for no other reason than to make sure my idea hasn&rsquo;t already been popularized and/or rendered moot by some prior academic giant.</p>

<p>As I read the philosophy books and listened to the philosophy podcasts, I didn&rsquo;t find anyone that had quite hit upon the points I was trying to make.  I also found that many of the philosophical frameworks were difficult to work with and build on.  Most either involved talking about purpose from a personal perspective (which I am specifically avoiding right now) or else based their philosophy on reality and/or being, either seeking to get God intimately involved or out of the way.</p>

<p>This was both frustrating and encouraging.  I felt I had unique ideas to put forth, but couldn&rsquo;t quite find a good philosophical framework to build on and really didn&rsquo;t want to start from scratch.</p>

<p>Then I came across Dr. Sean Carroll&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2Bsmws2" target="_blank"><em>The Big Picture</em></a> and I found exactly what I was looking for.  As I poured through all the groundwork of he had laid out and developed an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">poetic naturalism</a>, I was delighted at having finally found a foundation for my ideas.  However, as I read more I was sure Carroll had either reached the same conclusions or had already dismissed them in some fundamental way.</p>

<p>Yet, when I had finished the book and looked up some of his related work, I realized that Carroll had not reached the same conclusions regarding the purpose of life.  In fact, his train of thought had cleared many of the obstacles in my way, delivered me almost to the doorstep of my destination, and provided me with a set of shiny tools to clear the rest of the way!</p>

<h3 id="cliffsnotes-from-minutephysics">CliffsNotes from MinutePhysics</h3>

<p>Of course, resting so much of my own work on this new book means that I basically have a 430 pages of required reading in order to understanding what I&rsquo;m talking about.  That would make things difficult, but luck is with me again as Carroll and Henry Reich, from the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg" target="_blank">MinutePhysics</a> channel, have already covered the key points I need in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoaVOjvkzQtyZF-2VpJrxPz7bxK_p1Dd2" target="_blank">5-part video series</a> that is a combined length of only 21 minutes!</p>

<p>Even if you have read <em>The Big Picture</em>, I would still highly recommend this video series since some concepts are restated differently and MinutePhysics is just great content.  I&rsquo;m going to embed a few for convenience and to help reference their content; here is the first video in the series:</p>

 </div>


<h3 id="the-big-picture-philosophy">The Big Picture Philosophy</h3>

<p>Carroll doesn&rsquo;t get into his philosophical framework in the MinutePhysics videos, so let&rsquo;s quickly restate the tenets of poetic naturalism as defined in <em>The Big Picture</em><a name="ref-0"><a href="#note-0">[0]</a></a> since it is quite important to my story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naturalism comes down to three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only one world, the natural world.</li>
<li>The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.</li>
<li>The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially, naturalism is the idea that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world.  The poetic aspect comes to the for when we start talking about the world.  It can also be summarized in three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are many ways of talking about the world.</li>
<li>All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.</li>
<li>Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.</li>
</ol>

<p>(p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about individual interactions between atoms you will use a different narrative and language than when you&rsquo;re discussing large collections of atoms.  Quantum and molecular interactions are definitely taking place within gases, however, for the purposes of analyzing the properties of gases the best way of talking isn&rsquo;t to invoke wave functions, but to discuss the gas laws.</p>

<p>This is relatively straightforward and much of the book discusses how the emergence of different levels of observable phenomenon can be used to develop useful stories that match our understanding of how the world works scientifically.</p>

<h3 id="michael-russell-s-and-sean-carroll-s-stories-of-life-s-purpose">Michael Russell&rsquo;s and Sean Carroll&rsquo;s Stories of Life&rsquo;s Purpose</h3>

<p>Returning to the purpose of life, it seems that many true stories could exist, so long as they follow these tenets.  The only direct reference to a &ldquo;purpose of life&rdquo; that Carroll refers to in his book appears at the beginning of chapter 32, &ldquo;The Origin and Purpose of Life&rdquo;, where he recalls a chance encounter with Dr. Michael Russell, an astrobiologist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>While both were en route from northern California to a conference in Montana they happened to be seated next to each other on the same plane.  When Russell happened to notice that Carroll was studying statistical physics in relation to the origins of life, he commented on his familiarity with the work.  When Carroll asked his opinion on life&rsquo;s purpose as it related to the work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy&rdquo;, he replied with a nod.  &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(p. 261)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I proceeded from this point, I was expecting Carroll to refer to this simply as a true story at the level of the chemical process of life and then put forth another story of purpose that would be apply to higher level processes.  Instead he goes on to cover many other interesting and important topics, but never quite returns to a higher level story for life.</p>

<p>However, he does cover this in more detail in the last video of the MinutePhysics series where he reaches a slightly different conclusion from Russell.</p>

 </div>


<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a very real sense, the purpose of life is to continue the mission of the stars.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I understand it, the mission of the stars and life is to provide a path for energy to to increase entropy, going from useful concentrated energy to useless diffuse energy.</p>

<p>This is where we transfer from Carroll&rsquo;s thought train to mine, taking the tool of poetic naturalism in hand/mind.</p>

<h3 id="my-story-of-life-s-purpose">My Story of Life&rsquo;s Purpose</h3>

<p>As much I enjoy doing my part to hydrogenate the carbon dioxide of Earth, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t get me out of bed in the morning.  And while Carroll&rsquo;s story is beautiful, I think there is key piece missing that becomes quite meaningful for conscious life-forms when considered.</p>

<p>I think my story is just as simple and really I&rsquo;m just adding a line to connect some dots and then filling in a single space, quite literally.  The line was actually already drawn by Carroll in his book, and by Reich in the third video in his series.</p>

<p>In the book, Carroll discusses the evolution of complexity and entropy within closed systems (ch. 28, p. 225).  Over time, the entropy of a closed system always increases, while the complexity of the system will increase and then decrease in a parabola.</p>

<p>As we can see, we exist in the middle of this graph, at a relatively nondescript point on the entropy line, but at a vertex of the complexity parabola.  This complexity line is the key point that Carroll leaves out of his story about life&rsquo;s purpose, and the fact that Life is by far the most complex process known in the Universe, it defines what will be the highest point of that curve.</p>

<p>Defining the high point on the complexity curve also means that life defines where on the time axis the curve will decline back toward simplicity.  This happens when the complexity of life declines, and while unconscious life does not have the ability to consider that eventuality, conscious life most certainly does.</p>

<p>It is self-evident since I am doing it right now with you.  Now we come to my story for what I believe is the true purpose of life:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve within its enclosing system.</strong></p>

<h3 id="life-s-complexity-curve">Life&rsquo;s Complexity Curve</h3>

<p>If we could actually plot the complexity of life on Earth over time since it began, it would not be that nice smooth parabola.  Quantifying the actual complexity of the living system of Earth would be pretty difficult, considering that complexity describes the amount of information we need to describe a system, a good rough guide would be the curve of biodiversity of life over time.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ll defer to Youtube for a nice brief overview, this time by Emily Elert of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiYXex_fwgYDonaTcSIk6w" target="_blank">MinuteEarth channel</a>.</p>

<p>They describe the difficulty of generating data on biodiversity from the fossil record, but they mention that many have been made.  Other diversity curves have been developed, one can be found on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event" target="_blank">Extinction Event</a>, but a better looking version was published recently on the <a href="http://www.bitsofscience.org/" target="_blank">Bits of Science site</a>:</p>

<p>If we focused only on the complexity from biodiversity we could plot this graph out based on our knowledge of how often mass extinction would occur from geological and cosmological triggers.  Here is a Wikipedia page dedicated to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future" target="_blank">timeline of the far future</a>, where it lays out many possible extinction events before the Sun&rsquo;s luminosity increases to the point where it disrupts C3 photosynthesis wiping out 99.9% of plant species.  If life maintains it&rsquo;s upward trend of complexity to that point, then it will need to adapt quite drastically or else life on this planet will face the final trend downward toward equilibrium and simplicity.</p>

<p>The Sun&rsquo;s luminosity is estimated to reach this point in ~600 million years, and since that diversity curves plotted go back ~542 million years, that puts us roughly in the middle of the total estimated timeline.  And speaking of us, let&rsquo;s consider how consciousness life affects complexity.</p>

<h3 id="complexity-from-consciousness">Complexity from Consciousness</h3>

<p>Not all species are equally complex and measuring complexity for organisms and populations would be pretty difficult and take us down a rabbit hole that I&rsquo;m even less qualified to navigate than the one we&rsquo;re currently exploring.</p>

<p>However, I feel like I can stay in safe territory by saying that the most complex structures of the life-forms of Earth are the nervous systems and brains which generate behaviors.  Amongst those organisms with brains, the more complex ones are the ones which generate the most complex behaviors.  If complexity is a measure of how much information is required to describe a system, then more information you need to describe how an organism will behave in any given situation, the more complex that organism is.</p>

<p>When you reach consciousness and consider what it is like to be conscious and myriad ways a conscious brain can work to generate novel behaviors, complexity for a single mind is pretty much off the charts.  Now considering how many minds interact to create the vast varieties of social groups, languages, customs, civilizations and technology; the complexity curve for a living system containing conscious life-forms becomes immediately skewed.</p>

<p>Conscious life changes everything and it also creates a massive opportunity for the living system it is apart of, assuming it can leverage its capabilities effectively and align them with the main purpose of life.  Here is where my story of purpose has meaning for conscious beings, such as ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="the-purpose-of-conscious-life">The Purpose of Conscious Life</h3>

<p>The purpose is to optimize the area under the curve, not to simply seek a maximum for the curve.  Complexity comes at a cost and the enclosing system is finite, so if conscious life purely seeks a maximum, then it will almost certainly trigger another mass extinction, possibly destroying themselves in the process, and making their era just another blip on the larger complexity curve of life.</p>

<p>Many people believe this what is being observed currently in what is being called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction" target="_blank">Holocene Extinction</a>.  If conscious life removes large amounts of biodiversity in order to generate resources to maintain and further their civilization and technology complexity, then they are not truly maximizing the area under the curve.</p>

<p>Human beings have a consciousness that can recognize and study patterns, they can understand complexity and measure their effects on their living system.  Lately, many great minds have studied the nature of complexity and written extensively on the problems faced when it grows too large:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter" target="_blank">Joseph A. Tainter&rsquo;s</a> book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2HbhZhK" target="_blank">The Collapse of Complex Societies</a>, covers this topic from an archaeological point of view, extensively studying past civilizations and how increased complexity within societies generates diminishing marginal returns with regards to energy economics.  This was also covered in a related paper, <a href="https://www.goldonomic.com/tainter.htm" target="_blank">Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Crutchfield" target="_blank">James P. Crutchfield&rsquo;s</a> paper <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/papers/FOCS.pdf" target="_blank">The Hidden Fragilities of Complex Systems - Consequences of Change, Changing Consequences</a> discusses how &ldquo;Short-term survival and an exuberant plunge into building our future are generating a new kind of unintended consequence&emdash;hidden fragility.&ldquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb" target="_blank">Nassim Nicolas Taleb</a> covers the topic of fragility and complexity extensively in both of his works, <a href="http://amzn.to/2HdegR0" target="_blank">The Black Swan</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2CjJoKI" target="_blank">Antifragile</a>.  His ideas on robustness and anti-fragility are invaluable when considering how humans should pursue the purpose I&rsquo;ve been outlining.</p>

<p>I plan to dive deeper into these works in later posts, but for now, just know that I&rsquo;m not pulling these concepts out of thin air.</p>

<p>So, increasing complexity is both the purpose we seek and the surest path to failure.  However there are many ways we can leverage our increasing complexity to become less fragile, but since I&rsquo;m already over 2500 words, I&rsquo;m going to focus on a single thing that can change the equation.</p>

<h3 id="expanding-the-enclosing-system">Expanding the Enclosing System</h3>

<p>So once again, with some different emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve <em>within its enclosing system</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypothetical complexity graph covering 542 million years ago to 600 million years from now is the best case scenario for the closed system we call Earth.  But thanks to the evolution of conscious life, the invention of science, and the abundant resources available within this system; life now has the opportunity to expand the enclosing system.</p>

<p>On February 6th, 2018, just last week at the time of this draft, the Falcon Heavy rocket has just been successfully launched by SpaceX.  Elon Musk&rsquo;s ambition is to bring humans to Mars within the next decade and to eventually terraform the planet to sustain life-forms from Earth.  This is an example of leveraging our capabilities toward the purpose of life, since, if successful, there will be two enclosing systems.</p>

<p>When the sun&rsquo;s luminosity increases beyond the capability of photosynthesis on Earth, this will mean that the &ldquo;Goldilocks Zone&rdquo; will have been pushed out to exclude Earth, but will now include Mars.  This could add hundreds of millions of years to timeline and massively increase the potential area under the complexity curve.  With further advances in space technology a dedication to long-term thinking, we could even reach the point where the entire solar system is considered the enclosing system and add billions of years to the timeline.</p>

<p>But we don&rsquo;t actually even need to get to the point of terraforming Mars, we can very easily reach the point where we could potentially expand the system.  However this requires even more long-term thinking, like the type being done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_N._Mautner" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Mautner</a> and <a href="http://www.panspermia-society.com/" target="_blank">the Panspermia Society</a>.</p>

<p>Mautner outlines a plan for utilizing swarms of extremely small capsules filled with robust microbes which would be sent toward stellar clouds where new planets are currently forming with the expectation that some may arrive to find purchase on new worlds and give life a jump start.</p>

<p>When considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom" target="_blank">Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s</a> arguments for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" target="_blank">Simulation Hypothesis</a> it seems to me that we could apply similar arguments regarding the technological capability and motivations of a prior advanced civilization to make a case for Earth having been seeded by a prior panspermia initiative.  I&rsquo;m not going to attempt this right now, but I invite anyone else to try, it&rsquo;s time for me to wrap this up.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many good stories we can tell about the nature of life and it&rsquo;s purpose.  These stories need to be compatible with each other, they must match our scientific understanding of how the world works and the best stories must be applicable to the domain under consideration.</p>

<p>When considering the relationship between life&rsquo;s purpose and entropy, and the relationship between entropy and complexity, a story of life&rsquo;s that relates directly to complexity seems quite compatible.  When further considering of the relationship that conscious, problem-solving life-forms have to complexity, this story of purpose becomes quite applicable.</p>

<p>Human consciousness defines the path of the most significant complexity curve in the known Universe.  I believe that optimizing the area under this curve is the best way of aligning ourselves with the overall purpose of life in the Universe and that furthering our understanding of the nature of complexity, while dedicating ourselves to long term planning along this path is the surest way to a sustainable and successful future.</p>
