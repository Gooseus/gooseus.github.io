      <description>So what to write&amp;hellip; I need a plan of action.
There is an application I want to fill out:
1) Look at PhD Website for Systems Science.
2) Ask another person for a reference.
3) Ask a third person for a reference.
4) Write the reference skeleton for Mike to modify.
5) Write personal reference and essay for acceptance.
6) Send GRE scores to school.
7) Make sure transcripts are at school.</description>
