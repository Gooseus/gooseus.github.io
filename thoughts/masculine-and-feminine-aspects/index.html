<p>I had been hoping to publish a direct follow-up to my first article, <a href="/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life">The Purpose of Life</a>, but that&rsquo;s taking more time to flesh out than expected.  I&rsquo;ve been considering applying to graduate school while taking a class and also procrastinating on Twitter.  One of those procrastinations inspired this post here, which will eventually fit in with the overall theme (hopefully).</p>

<h3 id="controversial-conservative-ideas-on-twitter">Controversial Conservative Ideas on Twitter</h3>

<p>In this last week there has been a lot written regarding a collection of public thinkers that share a loose connection by way of having shared the experience of upsetting the sensibilities of vehement progressives and leftists; they&rsquo;ve been publicly dubbed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html" target="_blank">Intellectual Dark Web</a> and I don&rsquo;t think the branding has been helpful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been following a few of these thinkers for quite awhile and so had my own opinions on what was written, but largely kept them to myself.  Their controversies always seemed overblown and self-defeating for the people generating the controversy, but after a piece written by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html" target="_blank">NY Times about Jordan Peterson</a>, I found myself on joining the Twitter discussion.</p>

<p>I watched the original controversy with Jordan Peterson unfold online almost two years ago and have listened to a few of his class lectures and some other talks and videos he&rsquo;s made.  I was a fan of Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s ideas of allegory and so I found his lectures enjoyable, though having my very own &ldquo;religion&rdquo;, I found the emphasis on Christian myths to be less interesting.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was his description of the idea of the Masculine and Feminine.  He described it in conservative/Christian imagery, but it all sounded very similar to what I&rsquo;ve heard talking to people of a much more liberal/New Age persuasion.</p>

<h3 id="less-controversial-new-age-ideas-in-ceremony">Less Controversial New Age Ideas in Ceremony</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to sit in shamanic ceremonies and meet lots of people who describe the concept of masculine and feminine in very similar ways, though using more pagan/New Age imagery.</p>

<p>Their idea is that each person expresses different proportions of masculine and feminine &ldquo;energy&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m going to say &ldquo;aspects&rdquo;) and they stress the importance of allowing both to be expressed and not be repressed by a need to fit with cultural models of masculine and feminine.  Some people may be extremely feminine, but still feel the need to express masculine energy from time to time, almost nobody embodies purely one or the other.</p>

<p>They also believe that ideal relationships find a balancing between the energies in each partner.  This is described as a dance between the masculine and feminine aspects in each individual and it&rsquo;s important to give each partner space and opportunity to express each aspect in a healthy way.</p>

<p>It seemed to make sense to me and it seemed like Peterson was describing the same thing, however, the use of traditional language and the fact that his message was directed more at the men and focused on the masculine expression is what seemed to create the controversy.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-controversial-twitter-conversation">Back to the Controversial Twitter Conversation</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to endorse or defend Peterson, I got into the Twitter discussion by remarking on his &ldquo;enforced monogamy&rdquo; comment, which is a stupid phrase to utter without clarifying what you mean (unless you mean it exactly how it&rsquo;s being taken).  However, I also think that a journalist who doesn&rsquo;t try to clarify that comment with more questions and quotations is abdicating their responsibility to the reader, who you should assume has a serious desire to understand the person being profiled.</p>

<p>After someone linked to another tweet of Peterson&rsquo;s which seemed also to allude to tyrannical enforcement of marital responsibility, it seemed more likely that he might be implying actual state enforced monogamy.  I still don&rsquo;t know that would mean as actual policy proposals have not been forthcoming, but I don&rsquo;t see it carrying even a modest minority of the vote.  The conservation then turned toward other topics of status and gender roles, the real core of the controversy.</p>

<p>Peterson speaks largely to frustrated men and his topics seems to revolve around how to express and carry themselves in the world in such a way as to embody &ldquo;true&rdquo; masculinity.  He endorses traditional gender roles and seems to indicate the world should be ordered in this way because that is how it is designed by biology, women and men are different and they are happiest in relationships when they&rsquo;re carrying out their traditional roles.</p>

<p>This is where he gets into trouble with liberals/progressives who see those traditional roles as unfair and oppressive, which they historically have been.  However, what if we add incorporate the less controversial pagan/New Age ideas here?  Can there be a synthesis that reconciles this somewhat?</p>

<h3 id="synthesizing-gender-roles">Synthesizing Gender Roles</h3>

<p>It seems to me that the mistake Peterson and other conservatives (lots of other people as well) make is in tying the masculine aspect directly to men and the feminine aspect to women, tightly coupling physical sex with the psychological/emotional makeup.</p>

<p>Everything that is said about traditional roles can still make sense, and be much less controversial, if there is acknowledgment that nobody is 100% masculine or feminine and that while, on average, there is a larger correlation between the physical sex and the expression of an aspect, there is still enough variation to make decoupling them from each other more meaningful.</p>

<p>Imagine a number of psychological/emotional traits that align with the roles that are traditionally identified as belonging to one or the other gender.  The masculine aspect is defined as expressing more of certain traits and less of another and vice versa for the feminine.</p>

<p>A happy, healthy relationship will have a combined set of traits, contributed by each partner, which should reach a certain threshold for performing each role in the relationship.  I wouldn&rsquo;t see these traits as binary, but continuous, so if one trait was identified as &ldquo;Providing&rdquo; and another as &ldquo;Nurturing&rdquo;, then the more masculine individual might tend more toward providing than nurturing (and vice versa), but may still find themselves acting out a nurturing role as a healthy expression of their less prominent feminine aspect.</p>

<p>What this means is that you can be a feminine man in a happy and healthy relationship with a masculine women where the gender roles, as defined by sex, are reversed, but actually the aspects in the relationship are in perfect balance.  There can even be a balance of <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> masculine/feminine in each person, but with traits mirrored in each other.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about here is still binding masculine/feminine aspects to traditional gender roles, but decoupling them from the physical sexes.  In this way, Peterson&rsquo;s less crazy ideas can make sense without implying that people should be relegated to a particular role against their will based simply on sex chromosomes.</p>

<p>The problem with culture isn&rsquo;t only that women are relegated to the feminine roles against their will, but that men are expected to embody only the masculine roles, or else be denigrated.  Both men and women should be free to express their masculine and feminine nature, but when partnering they should seek to make sure they have a partner who compliments their nature in a way that will allow them to express themselves naturally while ensuring that all the proper roles are being filled.</p>

<p>I realize this isn&rsquo;t some new revelation and plenty of people have expressed these ideas, as I said at the beginning, I&rsquo;m basically just re-purposing knowledge I got from my New Age friends and attempting to synthesize them with ideas I&rsquo;ve heard Peterson put forth.</p>

<h3 id="some-quick-nerding-out-for-science">Some Quick Nerding Out, For Science!</h3>

<p>What I&rsquo;d love to see are studies that could quantify these masculine and feminine aspects, perhaps as measurements of hormones or presence of genetic markers, and then conduct a study gathering data about how various relationships divide up the different roles.  Find out how happy they are individually and within the relationship, and see if there are relationships to be found between the quantifiable aspects that were measured and the roles being carried out.</p>

<p>Are happier individuals those that carry out roles proportional to the matching traits?  Do happier relationships posses a combined configuration of traits and do they share roles proportional to their contributing traits?</p>

<p>Peterson makes much of the big five personality types, which seem to have good studies related to them, and he uses them frequently to show how men and women statistically score very differently on different types.  I think these would probably point toward the masculine and feminine aspects (more agreeable people having more feminine), but I imagine there are other useful dimensions out there that could be measured.</p>

<h3 id="building-bridges-avoiding-tug-of-war">Building Bridges, Avoiding Tug-of-War</h3>

<p>If I could be heard by those people directing the online the narrative (public intellectuals, journalists, etc), I&rsquo;d ask with them to please ask more questions of each other and search for new ideas that might act as bridges between ideas that are seemingly irreconcilable.  The last part of my conversation on Twitter regarding Peterson went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Catherynne</strong> - &ldquo;Nothing he says is about a happy healthy relationship. It&rsquo;s about dominance and traditional gender roles &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Gooseus</strong> - &ldquo;He definitely believes in traditional gender roles, but my impression was he saw them as equal parts that go together to make a happy/healthy relationship. that&rsquo;s less controversial, it&rsquo;s at least debatable &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Catherynne</strong> - &ldquo;Traditional gender roles bar half the species from contributing to its advancement in any way other than reproduction. That they are detrimental is not up for debate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are traditional gender roles up for debate if they are aligned with internal aspects of an individual&rsquo;s personality/nature (masculine/feminine personality dimensions) rather than with physical sex?  Is there another way we shift the conversation to avoid impasse?</p>

<p>Maybe not, and maybe I missed the point somewhere, but I refuse to believe that we can&rsquo;t re-frame conversations in such a way that people can find solid common ground and a table to share ideas at respectfully, where before all that seemed available was a pit of mud and a tug-of-war to see which side can get the other dirtiest.</p>
