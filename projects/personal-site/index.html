      <article><h3>Minimalist Website with built-in Command Console UX</h3>
<p>While rebuilding my personal site I wanted to experiment with some new libraries and frameworks. I had been pining for my <a href="/writing/on-learning-web-development-in-2005">web development roots</a>, when it seemed like I had a better grasp of the technology underlying what I was building. Modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue are powerful, but have so many dependencies, opinionated abstractions, syntactic sugar, and build requirements… it all seems like a lot of cognitive and computational overhead, especially for low to moderately complex applications.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.arrow-js.com/" target="_blank">ArrowJS</a> – a small, powerful reactivity library which reminded me of a super-simple React or a <a href="https://lit.dev/" target="_blank">Lit</a> without the Web Components and build requirements<sup class="note">1</sup>, so I decided to see what I could do with it.</p>
<p>This is when I had the idea for a website command console, similar those found in PC games, opened with the backtick (`) key which would overlay the page with a REPL-like CLI that could run functions, change the page state, and displays information.</p>
