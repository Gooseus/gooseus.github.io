      <article><h1>The Moonument</h1>
<p>The Moonument is an aspirational project to put a Monument to Humanity on the Moon. It is a relatively simple object designed to outlast humanity with some simple functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as a monument to Humanity that can persist for longer than would be possible on Earth without constant maintenance, while still being easy to discover.</li>
<li>Preserve a record of Humanity's language, knowledge, culture, in place isolated entirely from force on Earth.</li>
<li>Broadcast messages to Earth that can be received an open source radio receiver directed at the face of the Moon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This monument would prove that intelligence life on Earth had reached the Moon, and would be a testament to the existence and capabilities of Humanity long after we are gone. In addition, it would provide a stream of interesting and useful information to anyone on Earth with relatively simple means, acting as an egalitarian beacon of knowledge free to anyone with the motivation, a radio receiver, and visibility to the Moon.</p>
<p>The hope would be that for beacon to have a positive unifying impact on the existing population of Earth in the short-term, but should that fail or prove insufficient, would at least serve as as proof of our potential, and provide an archeological record for any future intelligent life. Exactly the sort of thing we would hope to find on an exoplanet that proved to host to intelligent advanced enough to access their local satellites before collapsing.</p>
<p>The project, while not simple, is certainly simpler than many existing Moon missions and feasible within the budget of a smaller country or larger corporation. Even if the monument could only broadcast messages for a few decades or centuries, it could be designed to degrade gracefully and still be detectable long after and allowing direct access to the information stored directly on it.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe this project is a moral and ethical imperative for Humanity, and considering it could be undertaken by a relatively small group of people with the right set of skills and resources, it seems like only a matter of time before someone carries it out. While political concerns could be hurdles, should they prove insurmountable, this seems like the a project that could still be pursued by a motivated private organization.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The Moonument should be placed in an accessible spot close to the center of the face of the Moon since tidal-locking keeps the Earth directly above this spot (save some slow wobbling) and this position would allow a static directional antenna on the monument to broadcast directly to the Earth without any moving parts, and would also make it easy to find for any future intelligence.</p>
<p>The Moonument would be designed to redirect solar energy as efficiently as possible into a repeating radio signal, potentially without any battery energy storage. While this means that the Moonument would not broadcast for 14 days while it received no sunlight, this could act as more clues to future intelligence about the nature of the monument while providing additional savings in complexity.</p>
<h2>Broadcast</h2>
<p>Depending on the final design, the Moonument could be capable of broadcasting a variety of messages, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repeating message of welcome and hope in all of Humanity's languages, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque">Pioneer plaques</a>.</li>
<li>A repeating message designed to help decode deeper compressed information being broadcast, a la the Contact.</li>
<li>A compressed set of documents containing the sum total of Humanity's current understanding of the Universe. A subset of Wikipedia, the Internet Archive, Arxiv.</li>
<li>Instructions on how to access the deeper Moonument archive, containing a more complete record of Humanity's knowledge and culture.</li>
</ul>
